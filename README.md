## App description
Movieboxd is an app that provides way for everyone to not only log movies for your own personal diary, but also plan a movie-hangout! Create a profile with your favorite upcoming movies through our movie tracker, interact with other users to see what upcoming movies they would like to see with our integrated chat system, and see what theaters in your area are showing the movie you want to watch through our Movie Map. You and your friends will be able to buy the movie tickets in advance by directing you to theaters from our app. Missing out on a showing would no longer be a worry! Consistently update your diary and your likely ever-growing watchlist, talk with other fellow cinephiles, and plan your future movie-night-outs with your family or friends through Movieboxd!
